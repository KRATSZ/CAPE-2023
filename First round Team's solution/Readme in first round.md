# Introduce
## The synbio challenges
The 2nd Synthetic Biology Competition-Innovation Competition breaks the routine and innovates the way of competition, which is proposed to be divided into three parallel segments: the routine competition, the big facility competition-bacterial gaming, and the big facility competition-protein design. Participating teams are free to choose to participate in one or more of the above according to their actual situation.
The competition encourages undergraduates and graduate students who are passionate about synthetic biology to explore the innovation and application of synthetic biology in different fields from the perspective of their interests, and at the same time, it provides a platform for young students to communicate and learn from the top scholars face-to-face and to show their own creativity and creativity!

## The Round1 
Round 1 was organized as synbio Challenges, as part of the synbio Challenges competition, players constructed and predicted 96 optimal sequences for mutations to submit. Players were invited to give offline PPT presentations and algorithm explanations, and the team with the best results was finally evaluated.

## The champion
In this round, team "**m-RNA**" from Nanjing University and team "**Hust_Chem**" from Huazhong University of Science and Technology won the Grand Prize of Protein Design Competition.The champion team"**m-RNA**"code are abled to find in the kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/code/littlejian/coarse-grained-scan-gan
