# Introduce
This folder includes the second round of teams' algorithm presentation (.ipynb format), which are a good showcase of the teams' algorithmic design ideas and uniqueness. 

The following is the introduction about the round and the team that won the championship
### The synbio challenges
The 2nd Synthetic Biology Competition-Innovation Competition breaks the routine and innovates the way of competition, which is proposed to be divided into three parallel segments: the routine competition, the big facility competition-bacterial gaming, and the big facility competition-protein design. Participating teams are free to choose to participate in one or more of the above according to their actual situation.
The competition encourages undergraduates and graduate students who are passionate about synthetic biology to explore the innovation and application of synthetic biology in different fields from the perspective of their interests, and at the same time, it provides a platform for young students to communicate and learn from the top scholars face-to-face and to show their own creativity and creativity!

### The Round1 
Round 1 was organized as synbio Challenges, as part of the synbio Challenges competition, players constructed and predicted 96 optimal sequences for mutations to submit. Players were invited to give offline PPT presentations and algorithm explanations, and the team with the best results was finally evaluated.

### The Round2
Participants in this round submit their code on kaggle.Integrating Kaggle and biofoundries as open platforms for data and experimentation, the CAPE challenge represents an accessible infrastructure to both protein and data scientist, hoping to promote the wide use of machine learning in protein design and function prediction. 

At the stage of network construction algorithm, "Meinamejiandan" from Beijing University of Chemical Technology used the Euclidean distance between amino acid information and 3D structure as the graph feature, and constructed a **GNN model** by using a three-layer graph isomorphism network (GIN), which won an excellent score on the Kaggle leaderboard.

However, **"AIforbio"** from Shandong University stood out in the testing section!Win the final champion.Utilizing the amino acid information and three-dimensional structure, using Embedding layer and positional encoding layer for sequence encoding and prediction, combined with **Multi Head Attention(MHA)**, and finally accurately predicted the key features in the amino acid sequences as well as the impact on the activity and selectivity by MLP.
